The repository contains two folders, Data and Script. Data contains the three datasets used for this project. The major dataset is the ___total quarterly energy consumption.csv___ which contains the total quarterly consumption data in the UK from the first quarter in 1998, till the first quarter in 2023. The other two datasets: ___UK_gdp.csv___ and ___covid_endog.csv___ are explanatory variables to get a better prediction for the forecast model used.

The Script folder contains the notebook used where the analysis, visualizations and model development were performed.
